There is a excel file attached with my completed module 1 challenge.
These are the questions that I answered below. I could not figure out how to upload the word file.

1.	Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?
a.	The first conclusion that we are able to draw is that the most successful crowdfunding campaigns were those in the theater industry. Furthermore, this industry drew more attention than any other. 
b.	The most successful campaigns were those that had goals between 15000 to 34999 dollars.
c.	Lastly, the practice of crowdfunding is generally successful practice of obtaining funds for projects
2.	I would argue that a limitation of this data would be there is not enough information to measure how successful crowdfunding campaigns are across all industries. For example, there is no data for companies that are involved in business related fields such as finance based companies or real estate projects. Another limitation is that there is no information about the nature of the companies and which ones were more likely to be successful than others.
3.	Another graph interesting graph that could be implemented is a correlation that compares the amount of backers to the success rate. I wonder if there would be definite trendline that shows if those variables have any correlation.
4.	I believe that the mean best summarizes the data best because there are no significant outliers. Therefore, it represents the central value of the data.
5.	There is more variability in the successful campaign data set. This makes sense because there is more data within that data set. Furthermore, the range of the data is much more spread.
